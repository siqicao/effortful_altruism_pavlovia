# What previous work did not investigate are 
1)	measurements of willingness to put effort is far from a real physical or cognitive effort exertion process. 
*	Past studies instruct subjects to image a scenario in which they could help others. However, these studies have examined people’s judgments in hypothetical scenarios, but recent work suggests hypothetical judgments cannot accurately predict real decisions.
2)	Effort itself could be a cost, however, mostly we will encounter with more explicit material cost such as money and food as the support for living which independent of the effort that task requires.
3)	What is more, willingness to exert effort usually decreases as a function of the amount of effort already applied. 
*	It is clear that effort expenditure does eventually decline with time on task (Inzlicht et al., 2018). So, we would like to explore the temporal behavior oscillation of the implementation of effortful help under the cost/cost-free context.

This document describes in detail hypotheses, computational models, experimental design, procedures, analyses and results from a behavioral and fMRI study, which we herewith describe as “Experiment 1”. This experiment was conducted to investigate the following questions:

(1)	Is there two kind of loss-aversion effect (self vs. other)that results in higher levels of effort-based altruistic behavior or prosocial apathy for others? 
(2)	What kind of behavior oscillation could be observed along the time?
(3)	Heterogeneity across individuals.
*	There is research believed that altruism and caring behavior lie on a continuum with extreme altruists on one side and psychopaths, who typically lack empathy and care for others, on the other side.

# Research Question 
* One question is whether social decisions are the result of a single comparison process, or the result of two processes: one, a fast and intuitive process and the other, a slow and deliberative process7,10? 
* The second question is whether people exhibit a selfish or pro-social bias? The latter question is usually posed under the presumption of dual processes: given that there is an intuitive process, does it favor selfishness or pro-sociality?
